Here's my attempt to describe
How you make me feel so alive
I'll break it down one time
So listen line by line
Listen line by line
Listen line by line
You're my Stairway to Heaven, you're Freddy Mercury
You've got a License to Ill, and girl it worked for me
You're Johnny Cash singing to a penitentiary
You're Graceland, The Band, and Petty falling free
You're Stir it Up, yeah you're Jamming, you're my Redemption Song
I'm Knocking on Heaven's Door and you're Forever Young
I'm just a kid in the stand waiting for the show
I clap my hands
'Cause you're my favorite song
I just wanna sing along
And it goes like this
